        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Our project aims to simulate the atmospheric conditions and surface features of Jupiter using computer graphics techniques. 
    By creating a realistic representation of Jupiter, we hope to enhance understanding and appreciation of the largest planet 
    in our solar system. The team consists of Roger Yu, David Tan, Jerry Li, and Angel Aldaco.</p>

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>The problem of simulating Juipter using computer graphics techniques is difficult due to the complexities of the original model itself. Considering 
            the size of the model along with how light sources of the sun interact with it reqiures to consider how we (re-)build our ray tracer similar to the
            assignment of homework 3. This grows in complexity when we add on the ability for weather effects such as cloud formations (an important factor considering its 
            known as the gas giant), storms, and its interactions with light sources. This builds up to our most difficult task: (1) using shaders to build juipters enviroment
            and (2) having that interaction between weather effects and light sources. As for how we are going to solve it, going into research of graphics is going to be a great start especially since things
            such as fog (similar to clouds) is something with readily aviable research, along with sticking to the timeline.

        <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        <h3>Metrics</h3>
        <ul>
            To measure the quality of our simulation, we will integrate render performance metrics and how photorealistic/visually-aligned 
            our simulation is compared to a real set of images capturing gaseous motion on Jupiter. We plan to measure the amount of time 
            spent rendering per frame, aiming to keep it under a certain threshold, such that we will be able to render at least a 10 second
            demo for our final demo. We plan to deliver a short 10 seconds clip, with 30 frames per second, that showcases this simulation.
            We do not have a defined system for judging how photorealistic our simulation will be, but we have a set of criteria to judge as a team 
            on the visual quality of our renders. We aim to have detailed, natural-looking, realistic illumination, for our renders.
            We plan to take into account light refraction through the gaseous particle cloud to add onto the realism of our simulation.
        </ul>

        <h3>Baseline Plan</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement Jupiter with the correct textures applied (this should contain an artifact as a photo)</li>
            <li>Implement a path tracer with global illumination using the sun as a light source while maintaing juipter's texture</li>
            <li>The last point should be able to provide picture of juipter and can be used as an artifact</li>
            <li>Implement Juipter's gaseous enviroment and clouds with motion using shaders </li>
            <li>This should have a video artifact showing it.</li>
            <li>Maintain the light source while having it interact with Jupiter's environment </li>
            <li>Maintain a reasonable preformance such as it taking around an hour to create and artifact</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Aspirational Plan</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Incorporate real-time data to simulate current conditions on Jupiter.</li>
            <li>Add in sparkling stars in the background with varying degrees of brightness.</li>
            <li>Include planetary self-rotation.</li>
            <li>Include orbital motion around the sun.</li>
        </ul>

                    Starting to research rendering techniques for gaseous motion so we can begin implementation,
                    and create a template environment for our render.
                    This environment should include a light source (the sun) and the sphere representing Jupiter

                    Implement path tracer with global illumination, using sun as the light source.
                    We aim to encapsulate the scenery with a large cornell box (faces not in render)
                    so that we can obtain light reflections illuminating the backsides of Jupiter too.
                    The environment should now have a glowing sun (bright point light) and illuminated
                    Jupiter with correct surface texture.

                    Implement dynamic gaseous surface on Jupiter such that by the end of the week, we will have a 
                    functional dynamic texture on Jupiter's surface that mimics gaseous motion on the planet.
                    Currently planning to use shaders that can be updated in runtime with respect to time, that
                    modifies the rendering. Alternatively, we can implement this using spring movement and render
                    the surface by mapping the uv coordinates on texture to each point mass.
